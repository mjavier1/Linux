Need to build your own GNS3 topology?
Welcome!

I am often faced with a difficult decision when creating courses...

1) Do I put all the installation and setup videos at the beginning of the course? 

2) Or do I put all the setup videos at the end of the course?

The problem with option 1 is that some of you can spend many hours going over content that is irrelevant to you.... adding lots of GNS3 content at the beginning of the course will make this course a GNS3 course rather than a Linux course.

So, I have decided to put all the GNS3 installation and setup videos at the end of the course. If you don't have a GNS3 environment set up, or you don't have the appliances I use in the videos, jump to the end of the course and watch the GNS3 setup videos.

Otherwise, go to the next video to get started using Linux and GNS3!

What do you think? Is this the right approach?

I want to wish you all the very best!
